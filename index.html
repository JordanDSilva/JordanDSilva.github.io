          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>I am an astrophysicist from Perth, Western Australia! My current work is focussed on understanding the physics of star formation and the growth of super massive black holes across cosmic time through the analysis of the energy distributions of galaxies.</p>
          <p> Observations from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Webb_Space_Telescope" target="_blank">James Webb Space Telescope</a> are at the centre of my research as I aim to unveil the details of among the first galaxies to ever exist in the Universe. Particularly, the sources of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reionization" target="_blank">cosmic reionisation</a>.</p>
          <p>In addition to astronomy, I have a few hobbies. I enjoy reading üìñ, hiking üå≤, taking photographs üì∏ and surfing üèÑ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. I'm also trying to write a novel! ‚úçÔ∏è.</p>

          <h3>Spectral energy distribution fitting</h3>
          <p>Better understanding the spectral energy distribution of galaxies is the focus of my research. The colour of fireworks gives an indication of their chemistry, for example red fireworks are made from strontium. The same is also true in galaxies where their colours are signatures of the physical properties of the stars, gas, dust and super massive black holes in the galaxies. The plot below shows an example spectral energy distribution and model fits to the observed light using the software <a href="https://github.com/asgr/ProSpect" target="_blank">ProSpect</a>. <b>Click the image to read the paper where this work was presented!</b></p>

          <h3>JumProPe</h3>
          <p>I am the lead developer of the novel JWST image processing pipeline: JWST UWA ProTools Processing Endeavour. JumProPe was designed to be easy to use and easily deployable to smoothly start processing images from JWST. JumProPe has since been used to prepare data for many publications and was even featured on a few NASA press releases, including the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/19/science/christmas-stars-galaxies-webb-nasa.html">Christmas Tree Cluster</a> that was featured in the New York Times in November, 2023. <b>Click the image to learn more!</b></p>
